Meetings are indeed tiring, but they can be a way to move our work forward and straighten out what needs to be done. Here I just want to discuss from a personal *POV* as a technical person about when a meeting can be tiring.

Before that, I want to say that I like meetings, I like discussions, exchanging arguments, even debating, *it's fine for me*, especially if the topic is interesting. I consider it also an *opportunity* for me to learn.

There is one thing I want to tell, so... when meeting in a certain group, I'm *aware* if there are meeting members who seem very active in the meeting, surely that attracts attention, *I believe everyone would agree with me*.

But here, what catches my attention is the way they speak, their gestures, intonation, *but wait..* here I don't want to generalize, but there are some people I met whose way of expressing their thoughts seems forced, feels like they just want to be heard and participate in the meeting.

This can be seen from the way they speak, such as raising their voice, their intonation looks nervous, long-winded arguments not getting straight to the point, it's tiring...

Sometimes what makes it tiring is, because they dominate the meeting, it's difficult for others to speak too, the topic being discussed moves to another topic because of the long-winded discussion. Even though the previous topic wasn't *clear*, in the end because the technical kids are the ones doing the work, they have to think independently again *after meeting*.

One more thing, when we want to discuss a solution, indeed they provide a solution, everyone knows it is indeed a solution, but try to think, solutions for one problem can be very many, in our heads maybe it could be one solution out of many solutions being thought of, don't just throw it into the discussion :), the meeting becomes long right. *so disturbing*.

*IMO* or *at least*, we need to think first *which solution is the best in our mind, it's okay to wait for a while*, and that's what we should discuss and *improve*.

I once heard from someone, people who talk excessively often try to prove themselves, this actually shows that they are *insecure*. *I'm not saying this* though.

We also understand, we are all learning, *I'm not saying that I'm good, maybe sometimes I'm the one who talks too much*, I'm also still learning, and they might also have **tried hard** to contribute in the meeting, without them, the meeting might feel quiet and there is no trigger, but yes, it can very well be *improved* together.

> *I’ve faced people like that at work, In my mind I feel myself wondering how to deal with these people..., I think I need to be more logical than before, good in argument, I know there is something wrong in their logic in the big picture but I’m not fast enough to figure it out and explain it in a clear way. I will improve this always.*
