I once heard a story from a close friend of mine. He was in a difficult situation, being extorted by certain parties—I can't mention who here haha. He told me he was threatened if he recorded what was happening.

It's understandable, my friend was the victim, where could he get justice in such a situation?

That basis is what led me to create this software. I didn't give it a special name, just a plain name "Hidden Cam".

How to use it is simple, it can be accessed through the website here: https://hidden-cam.vercel.app/.

Don't worry, the video results will be stored in your own browser, not on a server. And this is also open-source, so you can see what the code looks like inside. Github: https://github.com/riparuk/hidden-cam-web.

The way it works is easy. Inside there is a YouTube video that can be played. The recording will run as long as the video is playing until it is stopped, that will become one recording.

There is an indicator in the top left as a camera preview if it is active. You can also turn off the preview if you don't need it.

If you want to see your recordings, select "Saves". You can see the recordings you have made. Recordings are saved in `.webm` format. I tried on iPhone Safari, unfortunately, it cannot be played, but it can still be recorded and downloaded.

Use it wisely, Thank you :)
