So, this website is my personal space that I created as an **archive of knowledge and reflection**—a place where I store things that I might want to reread, understand again, or share with others someday.

In this blog, I write in my own style to keep it simple and easy to understand. Sometimes in English, sometimes in Indonesian. The topics vary... it could be IT, technical notes, tips and tricks, life philosophy, self-awareness, personal views, important lessons, and reflective things that I find relevant and useful. Not all writings are technical, and not all are reflective. I let this blog grow organically, following what I am learning and thinking about.

This website started on June 14, 2023. **You can see the date at the very top after the title**, but now I'm updating the writings here specifically to align with my goals.

Initially, this website was built using **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages** because it was lightweight and free.

> **Update February 3, 2026:** I now use **Hugo** as a static site generator, and I have moved all old writings—including this page—to a new repository.
