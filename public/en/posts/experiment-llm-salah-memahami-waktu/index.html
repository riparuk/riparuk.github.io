in my app was not working as expected. This happened several times even with the same workflow I had done previously. I didn’t change anything, so my assumption is that the capabilities of the OpenAI gpt-4.1-nano model have changed.\nWhat happened to me was that the output from the gpt-4.1-nano LLM model often produced results that did not meet expectations. It gave the wrong time output, which is a major concern specifically for my application. Therefore, for the time being, I moved to gpt-5-nano because it is still relatively cheap, it worked, it is smarter, but a new problem appeared.\nGPT-5-nano takes a long time and requires huge tokens (can be 4x larger) due to reasoning, whereas my system does not require it and also because I use my own internal reasoning system which is simpler and has small token usage.\nI tried looking for a way to disable it, but it turns out some models do not support disabling reasoning, such as gpt-5-nano itself. I considered gpt-5-nano because the price is also cheaper compared to the previous nano model (gpt-4.1-nano), but the problem here is that the response takes a very long time due to reasoning.\nOnly a few models support disabling reasoning for GPT-5 versions and above, you can check here:\nNeed reasoning false option for GPT-5 update I tried to compare the price and specification differences on the OpenAI models detail page. Here are the differences for the nano models, GPT-4.1 nano and GPT-5 nano.\nWhen this article was written, GPT-5 nano was cheaper in terms of INPUT-OUTPUT price but its reasoning cannot be disabled. If you think about it, it doesn’t end up being cheap either because the tokens are larger and it also takes a long time for a response.\nSo I want to try to stay on gpt-4.1-nano so the price remains cheap and fast. The problem here is how I can overcome that issue. This article will discuss the use case that occurred and the experiments I conducted.\nRequirements and Approach My requirement is that I need the model to understand the timing from the user text input, such as “this morning”, “2 days ago”, etc. The approach I have taken so far is to take the current time from the server and provide it into the context and set the prompt template to follow that. I did that because LLM models by default do not know the current time accurately as the model only knows information from the training data.\nThis worked as expected in many cases, but recently it hasn’t, and I tried to find out the problem and I discuss it here.\nThe AI flow of my system is roughly like this:\nYou might ask why generating user intent is necessary? The answer is because if the output directly extracts structured output to JSON, in many cases the result is hallucination. That’s why I use this approach to first understand the user’s intent in a structured way, then I extract it into JSON with the information that is actually needed. This could be called a simple Chain-of-thought for this matter.\nFor the COT prompt template, I ask the model to be like this:\n… follow this response format: Wait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add (fill in the blank) from (indicate the time range), current time is (HH:mm DD/MM/YYYY). therefore the expense list is: - 12,000 IDR for breakfast in the morning at 08:00 29/12/2023 - 16,000 IDR for lunch at an angkringan with chicken at 12:00 30/12/2023 … Problems Found Straight to the point, here are some examples of AI responses that did not meet expectations.\nUser Input: i bought coffe 15000 rupiah\nGenerated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a coffee expense of 15,000 IDR today. therefore the expense list is:\n15,000 IDR for coffee at 20:10 28/12/2023 AI Final:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"Coffee\", \"amount\": 15000, \"category\": \"Food \u0026 Drink\", \"currency\": \"IDR\", \"description\": \"\", \"transactionDate\": \"2023-12-28T13:10:00.000Z\"}]} User Input: Makan malam 15rb beli ayam murotal\nGenerated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a dinner expense of 15,000 IDR for buying Murotal chicken, and the transaction probably happened in the evening today. therefore the expense list is:\n15,000 IDR for dinner with Murotal chicken at 19:00 28/11/2023 AI Final:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"Dinner with Murotal Chicken\", \"amount\": 15000, \"category\": \"Food \u0026 Beverage\", \"currency\": \"IDR\", \"description\": \"Bought at Murotal Chicken restaurant\", \"transactionDate\": \"2023-11-28T12:00:00.000Z\"}]} It can be seen that the AI response was not prompted to mention the current time in its user intent, I think this is because my instructions were not strict enough.\nEh, turns out there is a log that mentions current time but it is wrong.\nUser Input: Lunch for 60 twd\nGenerated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a lunch expense of 60 TWD from an unspecified time, current time is 12:52 31/12/2023. therefore the expense list is:\n60 TWD for lunch at the current time 12:52 31/12/2023 AI Final:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"Lunch\", \"amount\": 60, \"category\": \"Food\", \"currency\": \"TWD\", \"description\": \"\", \"transactionDate\": \"2023-12-31T04:52:00.000Z\"}]} createdAt: 2025-12-31 04:52:17.271\n“current time is 12:52 31/12/2023” whatt? how? I actually included the current time date as context in the system prompt at the beginning, is the server time different? hmm maybe.\nMy assumptions here are 2:\nThe server current time is wrong. The LLM is hallucinating, because in my example instructions I mentioned 2023. I tried to look again at the latest user intent log data:\n“Wait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a purchase for mineral and snacks for 14,000 IDR, but the time of purchase is not specified. Therefore, the expense list is:\n14,000 IDR for mineral and snacks at (current time) (current date)” “Wait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a transaction for Warteg with a cost of 10,000 IDR. Therefore, the expense list is:\n10,000 IDR for Warteg at (current time in HH:mm DD/MM/YYYY)” “Wait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a keychain purchased for 90 TWD, but no specific time mentioned. Therefore, the expense list is:\n90 TWD for keychain at current time 14:33 23/01/26” “Wait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add expenses related to dinner, train, bubble tea, and biscuits, all in TWD, but no specific time range or current time specified. Therefore the expense list is:\n170 TWD for dinner at current time 44 TWD for train at current time 80 TWD for bubble tea at current time 25 TWD for biscuits at current time” Wait.. what, it didn’t generate the current time part correctly… hmm.\nLLM wrote it with the wrong format LLM rewrote the instructions But.. the ‘keychain’ part actually has the correct current time in the user intent, but … the Final Output is still wrong apparently, here is the log data:\nUser Input: Keychain for 90 twd\nGenerated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a keychain purchased for 90 TWD, but no specific time mentioned. Therefore, the expense list is:\n90 TWD for keychain at current time 14:33 23/01/26 AI Final:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"keychain\", \"amount\": 90, \"category\": \"Shopping\", \"currency\": \"TWD\", \"description\": \"a keychain purchased\", \"transactionDate\": \"2023-01-26T06:33:00.000Z\"}]} createdAt: 2026-01-23 06:33:15.640\nAnother new problem hmm…\nLook, apparently the LLM is confused, “23/01/26” should be the 23rd of the year 2026, not the 26th of the year 2023, oh my god it’s hard dealing with generated text like this lol.\nProblem Analysis My assumption points to the LLM… Can luxon produce null so that the LLM doesn’t get the current time now? I tried consulting ChatGPT about the ’luxon’ library, it said:\nOkay I take that as a fact.. if the DateTime is invalid, maybe the assumption that the current time results in 2023 is because the server could be correct too, getting more confused…\nOkay fine, my assumption now is that both have the potential to be the problem:\nThe current time is wrong, maybe because of the server, I use Vercel, maybe there is a connection because of serverless cold restart. The LLM is wrong, this is probably because I was also less strict in terms of prompting. I didn’t verify if the server time was different, it’s quite complicated to do because of that.\nApplied Solutions The solution I tried to apply:\nForce the client to send their current time, this is less likely to change I feel regarding the current time, unless the user changes the time \u0026 date on their device. Improve the AI prompt template, to force it to follow the instruction for the user intent response form, I added this as one of them. Is the problem solved? NOOO, I’m happy found another problem, look at this log:\nUser Input: Lunch for 60 twd\nGenerated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a lunch expense of 60 TWD, but I need to know the specific time when this happened. current time is 16:08 12/02/2026. therefore the expense list is:\n60 TWD for lunch at (time not specified) (12/02/2026) Final AI:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"Lunch\", \"amount\": 60, \"category\": \"Food \u0026 Drink\", \"currency\": \"TWD\", \"description\": \"\", \"transactionDate\": \"2026-12-01T17:00:00.000Z\"}]} Again the LLM misunderstood the date format, it should be the 12th of month 2, the LLM was confused and assumed that the transactionDate was the 2nd of month 12, so the transactionDate was wrong.. it’s okay.. so now the challenge is how to make the LLM understand a consistent date format. I changed the system prompt side:\nMy system prompt template had not adapted to ISO Format yet, so I changed it to be like this. To be more universal, it could be UTC+0, UTC+7, etc.\nIt turns out there is another indication why it was 2023, which is from my own prompt giving an example of 2023, maybe it could be biased towards that so the LLM hallucinated.\nNow this can be more consistent, I tried with user input = “Lunch for 60 twd”:\nGenerated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a lunch expense of 60 TWD today, current time is 2026-02-12T16:22:25.638+07:00. Therefore the expense list is:\n60 TWD for lunch at date 2026-02-12T16:22:25.638+07:00 AI Final:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"Lunch\", \"amount\": 60, \"category\": \"Food \u0026 Drink\", \"currency\": \"TWD\", \"description\": \"Lunch expense\", \"transactionDate\": \"2026-02-12T09:22:25.638Z\"}]} Generated User Intent:\nWait, I need to focus \u0026 understand carefully when the expense should be added to add expenses. I think user wants to add a lunch expense of 60 TWD. Since no specific date is mentioned, I will assume it was made today. Therefore the expense list is:\n60 TWD for lunch at date 2026-02-12T16:21:30.272+07:00 AI Final:\n{\"expenses\": [{\"name\": \"Lunch\", \"amount\": 60, \"category\": \"Food \u0026 Drink\", \"currency\": \"TWD\", \"description\": \"\", \"transactionDate\": \"2026-02-12T09:21:30.272Z\"}]} Conclusion At least now, the output is more consistent for the transaction date issue, although it can be seen that there are generated user intent results where the current time sentence does not appear :(. At least now the results are not hallucinations like before. This will continue to be improved and if I find something interesting, I will share it on my personal blog riparuk.github.io.\nThe conclusion is, when playing with LLM for strict predicted output cases like this, the system prompt must also be strict, especially if using a cheap and fast model. Every problem related to LLM hallucination must be strict in terms of prompting. Hope it helps.\n","wordCount":"2068","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2026-02-12T23:00:00+07:00","dateModified":"2026-02-12T23:00:00+07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/experiment-llm-salah-memahami-waktu/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Riparuk Web","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/en/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

At least now the results are not hallucinations like before. This will continue to be improved and if I find something interesting, I will share it on my personal blog <a href=https://riparuk.github.io>riparuk.github.io</a>.</p><p>The conclusion is, when playing with LLM for strict predicted output cases like this, the system prompt must also be strict, especially if using a cheap and fast model. Every problem related to LLM hallucination must be strict in terms of prompting.
