[{"content":"There are many expense tracking apps out there, but my main concern now is how to make expense tracking less manual—no need to fill in lots of data like item name, price, category, and so on.\nBut before that, there\u0026rsquo;s an experience that became the reason why expense tracking is necessary: when I was abroad. I live in Indonesia, where the cost of living is relatively cheaper compared to other countries. The currency difference made it difficult for me to compare how much I had spent so far.\nAt the time of writing this article, people often use ChatGPT for almost everything. This has become a habit because of the convenience and efficiency it provides.\nI thought, why not use a similar flow for expense tracking? So users would just need to input what they bought, the price, where they bought it, when they bought it, and so on.\nWith the current development of LLMs, I believe this is possible, and that became the foundation for why I created Traveed.\nFeatures Some of the major features of Traveed include:\nAI Expense Capture: Users only need to enter expenses by typing in everyday language, for example \u0026ldquo;Bought noodles for 15000 rupiah at Mrs. Ani\u0026rsquo;s stall\u0026rdquo;, and the AI will automatically separate that input into name, description, amount, and currency. Prompt Tuning: This is useful for customizing how the AI enters expense data. For example, if users want the AI to enter expense data in a specific format, language, or even style, they can set up prompt tuning to configure that format. 160+ Currencies Supported: Supports various currencies including IDR, USD, JPY, and others, with automatic conversion back to the main currency. This makes it easy for users to compare their expenses across different countries. Custom Categories: Users can set up their expense categories, and the AI automatically understands the available categories and uses them to categorize expenses. Summary As a developer, I use Traveed as my daily expense tracking app, and so far I\u0026rsquo;m satisfied with the existing features and continue to make improvements. It\u0026rsquo;s currently in BETA and can be accessed for free at https://traveed.app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:55799/en/posts/traveed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are many expense tracking apps out there, but my main concern now is how to make expense tracking less manual—no need to fill in lots of data like item name, price, category, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before that, there\u0026rsquo;s an experience that became the reason why expense tracking is necessary: when I was abroad.

Simply put, teachers can create questions and students can answer them there.\nI made the system like Google Forms. After the teacher creates the questions, there will be a link that students can access to answer the questions.\nDuring the creation process, I thought, why don\u0026rsquo;t I add AI to this system? I know\u0026hellip; not all software needs AI, it depends on the needs. Here I will discuss the creation process, from ideation to implementation.\nBut here I felt that instead of the teacher having to check each student\u0026rsquo;s answer one by one, why couldn\u0026rsquo;t it happen automatically? The teacher\u0026rsquo;s POV would only focus on making questions and providing the correct answers, the rest would be handled by AI acting as a judge between the correct answer and the student\u0026rsquo;s answer.\nThis is the basis for why I created Lazy Teacher. I made it separate with the hope that it can be integrated with existing e-learning systems.\nI tried to do some research\u0026hellip; by utilizing LLM (btw this was also hype when this was written), what features could I add? Some conclusions appeared.\nLLM can act as a judge, so teachers no longer need to check student answers one by one. LLM can create questions automatically. Before I started making Lazy Teacher, I needed to do a little research. First, what kind of questions would there be, when giving grades to students usually what range do teachers give, is there tolerance if, for example, a student answers with a typo?\nFrom these questions, I created several features in Lazy Teacher.\nThere are several types of questions that can be made, I took the general ones here ShortAnswer, Essay, or MultipleChoice. Can create questions manually. Can create questions automatically, either from documents or simple prompts, and can choose the number of questions too. Can evaluate student answers automatically. The value of each question can be set. Some examples of its use.\nGenerate questions from prompt import { QuestionGenerator } from \u0026#39;lazyteacher/generator\u0026#39;; const questionGenerator = new QuestionGenerator(); const user_prompt = \u0026#34;Question about AI Agent for future\u0026#34;; const total_questions = 3; const question_type = \u0026#34;multiple_choice\u0026#34;; const generated_questions = await questionGenerator.generateFromPrompt({ question_type: question_type, user_prompt: user_prompt, total_questions: total_questions }); console.dir(generated_questions); We can set several things here, for example, the total questions, question type, and also the prompt.\nGenerate questions from document import { QuestionGenerator } from \u0026#39;lazyteacher/generator\u0026#39;; import * as fs from \u0026#34;fs\u0026#34;; const total_questions = 7; const content = fs.readFileSync(\u0026#34;example.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;); const questionGenerator = new QuestionGenerator(); const question_generated = await questionGenerator.generateFromDocument({ question_type: \u0026#34;short_answer\u0026#34;, document_text: content, // in string total_questions: total_questions, chunk_size: 1000, chunk_overlap: 50, document_query: \u0026#34;Jakarta\u0026#34;, // query relevant document (optional) top_query: 5 // top query relevant (optional) }); Here the concept is still the same, but there are some additional parameters such as chunk size and chunk overlap to regulate how the document is broken down, as well as document query and top query to determine which parts of the document are most relevant to take. This is actually utilizing features already provided by LangChain, and it is very helpful so that the context given to the LLM can be more controlled.\nExample output:\n[ MultipleChoice { question: \u0026#39;What is one potential benefit of AI agents mentioned in the text?\u0026#39;, correct_answer: 0, type: \u0026#39;multiple_choice\u0026#39;, choices: [ \u0026#39;Enhancing productivity\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Increasing job displacement\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Reducing data privacy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Limiting personalized experiences\u0026#39; ], answer: undefined, score: undefined }, MultipleChoice { question: \u0026#39;What is a significant challenge associated with the rise of AI agents?\u0026#39;, correct_answer: 1, type: \u0026#39;multiple_choice\u0026#39;, choices: [ \u0026#39;Streamlining operations\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Data privacy concerns\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Improving healthcare\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Enhancing customer service\u0026#39; ], answer: undefined, score: undefined }, MultipleChoice { question: \u0026#39;According to the text, what is crucial as we integrate AI agents into our lives?\u0026#39;, correct_answer: 2, type: \u0026#39;multiple_choice\u0026#39;, choices: [ \u0026#39;Maximizing job displacement\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Ignoring ethical considerations\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Striking a balance between benefits and societal implications\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Focusing solely on technological advancements\u0026#39; ], answer: undefined, score: undefined } ] There are still many more features that can be explored, such as related to evaluation, scores, etc. For more details, I suggest you go directly to the documentation on github, https://github.com/riparuk/LazyTeacher.

At that time, we actually didn\u0026rsquo;t have an idea what we wanted to make yet, sounds like a trap right haha, but it\u0026rsquo;s okay, we discussed\u0026hellip; day by day we found out what potentially could win and we could make, and the idea kept changing.\nWhen we want to make an idea happen, it should make sense right (?), that\u0026rsquo;s why\u0026hellip; we read many papers, found out what others have done, what their methodology was, and so on.\nUntil finally, we made a decision to focus on the health sector and we chose to make a tuberculosis detector from breath. Sounds impossible at the time if you just heard about it, but this decision is actually possible, I will tell you why when I\u0026rsquo;m done with this post.\nAfter reading from several sources, the idea is we need breath from someone and analyze the VOCs in their breath. There are similar tools made before related to disease detection from breath, called e-nose, used for detecting COPD, diabetes, and many more. From here we understood that it is also possible if applied to tuberculosis. In several journals we also found that people infected with tuberculosis have VOCs in their breath that are different from healthy people, from there we concluded that it\u0026rsquo;s possible [1, 2].\nSimply put like that, now a problem arises. We already know what VOCs can be used to identify tuberculosis, but how can we analyze those VOCs? Maybe you adhere to using sensors (?), but you know, the tool to detect specific VOCs according to the research we got is very expensive\u0026hellip;. whereas the funds we have are impossible to buy that tool, the tool is called GC/MS (Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry).\nThis is where the power of machine learning is needed. The second idea is\u0026hellip; roughly speaking we don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the specific VOCs, but we can utilize machine learning algorithms to read patterns from those VOCs. Those patterns are from breath data given to the machine learning algorithm to create a model that can identify tuberculosis from breath.\nThe concept is like our nose, when we smell durian for example, from the nose sensors we have and then the data is sent to the brain, we know it smells like durian, but we don\u0026rsquo;t know specifically about the VOCs. Therefore, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to use the GC/MS tool but just cheap gas detection sensors of the Metal Oxide Sensor type, namely MQ-2, MQ-3, MQ-4, MQ-6, MQ-7.\nPrototyping The work started from design and making the tool. This was a process that was quite long and full of trial and error, I feel it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to tell in detail, the tool can be seen as in this picture.\nThe prototype is done, now is the time for us to try the tool. The next step here is we need to collect data from patients infected with tuberculosis and healthy patients.\nHonestly, this was a process that was quite long and more tiring than making the tool. We went from one hospital to another, puskesmas (community health center), even coming directly to houses to get breath samples, certainly with health protocols according to procedure. Errors in the prototype sometimes cannot be avoided, sometimes ran out of battery, there were problems on the server, or even there were problems in the prototype itself. But here I learned a lot of things, very worth it.\nI in this team was responsible for the Software system and AI model part. What I did here was providing a place for data collection, so I created a system where the system can receive breath data from the prototype via RestFul API, and in that system also the labeling process is done which can be accessed via website.\nMachine Learning Model Data has been collected and deemed sufficient, now is the time to make the machine learning model.\nThis stage is no less tiring than the previous stage. Here I worked alone, not as a team. I had to read various articles to find out the optimal way so that the model accuracy is good from the data that has been collected previously.\nSo, each breath sample was collected for 2 minutes. There, each sensor will have its own value. The data will go through a preprocessing stage before being entered into the model, including removing outliers and filtering.\nAfter the data is cleaned, the next stage is feature selection. Based on reading articles too, here the features extracted from that data are Pearson correlation coefficients and simple descriptive statistics.\nMax Min Range Pearson Correlation Coefficient When using these features to represent information from the breath data sample as a whole (120 seconds), the resulting model accuracy was not optimal, the model could not distinguish well between TB patients and healthy individuals.\nI tried reading again some literature [3, 4], and found one using sampling techniques. Simply put, we don\u0026rsquo;t take all the data, but take the most optimal data, and the result accuracy increased. From 2 minutes of data, only 30/40 seconds at the beginning were used / the best.\nThis means, if this tool is ready to be used later, breath samples collected don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for 2 minutes again, but just 1/4 of it.\nThese features have large data dimensions. Just imagine one breath data inside has signal data from 5 gas sensors. Before being given to the model, the data will be processed first with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. This method will reduce the data dimensions to 2 dimensions and is also easy to visualize.\nThe result is like this: And the resulting model accuracy is: You can judge for yourself which algorithm is suitable for this case.\nConclusion Before closing this writing, I also want to be honest and add something. If colleagues read this writing and want to do similar innovation, there are several things that need to be paid attention to. This result needs further testing for sure. What was tested in this project focused too much on the model accuracy side only. Many other things need to be paid attention to, such as tool consistency, sensors, data collection procedures, amount of data collected, and much more. Because of limited funds and time, unfortunately, we didn\u0026rsquo;t do that optimally, but this also gives us an illustration that a project like this is very possible to do and beneficial for many people in the future.\nAchievement Projects like this, rather than doing nothing, we also entered into competitions. Alhamdulillah we got several awards.

The AUR is insanely convenient, the wiki reads like a full-blown manual for life, and pretty much every tweak you’ll ever need is documented somewhere.\nI’ve hopped distro to distro—Mint, LXDE spins, XFCE, you name it—but I keep coming back to Arch Linux. The only thing that used to slow me down was the classic manual install. It’s powerful, sure, but wow it eats up time when all you want is a working system.\nThen I met the archinstall script. It’s the “I’m still cool, but also busy” way to install Arch. No shame, no gatekeeping—just a guided flow that still lets you shape the system exactly how you like.\nArchinstall ships with the official ISO and provides a structured UI for picking disks, packages, and the rest of the setup. It doesn’t remove control; it just cuts out repetitive typing.\nBefore launching archinstall First, prep the disk you’re going to wipe. This walkthrough assumes a fresh install, so back up anything important—archinstall will happily format the target disk. Second, grab the latest Arch ISO, flash it to a USB (Rufus, Ventoy, whatever works), boot into it, and get online. Wi-Fi via iwctl or just plug in Ethernet—doesn’t matter, as long as you can pull packages during install. Once you’re in the live environment and connected, fire up the guided installer by typing archinstall.\nSet/Modify the below options \u0026gt; Archinstall language set: English (100%) Keyboard layout set: us Mirror region set: [] Locale language set: en_US Locale encoding set: utf-8 Drive(s) Bootloader set: systemd-bootctl Swap set: True Hostname set: archlinux Root password set: None User account Profile set: None Audio set: None Kernels set: [\u0026#39;linux\u0026#39;] Additional packages set: [] Network configuration set: Not configured, unavailable unless setup manually Timezone set: UTC Automatic time sync (NTP) set: True Optional repositories set: [] Save configuration Install (2 config(s) missing) Abort (Press \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; to search) My go-to configuration Archinstall language: English (100%) Keyboard layout: us Mirror region: leave empty or pick mirrors near you Locale language: en_US Locale encoding: utf-8 Drive(s): choose the target disk Disk layout: Wipe all (yes, this erases everything on that disk) Bootloader: systemd-bootctl or GRUB (I lean systemd-bootctl) Hostname: whatever name makes you happy—mine is often just arch Root password: I skip it and rely on sudo User account: Select “Add a user”, type a username (mine’s ripa), set a password, answer “yes” when it asks if the user should be a sudoer, then Confirm and exit Profile: pick what you need—desktop -\u0026gt; kde if you want Plasma, and match the graphics driver to your hardware Audio: I go with pipewire Kernel: stock linux is fine unless you have a reason to change Additional packages: toss in extras like chromium if you want them right away Network configuration: Use NetworkManager Timezone: Asia/Jakarta Automatic time sync: True Optional repositories: usually just ['multilib'] so I can install Steam later When everything looks good, select Install, grab a drink while it copies files, then reboot into your fresh Arch setup.

Before doing anything fancy, make sure rclone is installed. Use whatever package manager your distro ships with—on my Arch box it’s simply sudo pacman -S rclone.\nCreate the Google Drive remote Run rclone config in your terminal. Pick n) New remote → type n and press Enter. Give it a name. I called mine gdrive-ripa—choose whatever makes sense for you. Select Google Drive as the storage type (in my menu it was option 18). Leave client_id and client_secret empty unless you have your own OAuth credentials. For the scope, I go with option 1: Full access to all files (drive). Skip service_account_file unless you know you need it. When asked about advanced config, I answer n) No. Say y to open a browser window for authentication, then sign in with the Google account you want to expose to rclone. I don’t use Shared Drives, so I answer n) No to that prompt too. Confirm everything with y) Yes this is OK when rclone summarizes the remote. You should now see something like this:\nCurrent remotes: Name Type ==== ==== gdrive-ripa drive e) Edit existing remote n) New remote d) Delete remote r) Rename remote c) Copy remote s) Set configuration password q) Quit config e/n/d/r/c/s/q\u0026gt; q Hit q (or Ctrl+C) to exit the config tool.\nMount the remote Create a folder that will act like your “Google Drive” view. I use mkdir ~/Google-Drive.\nMount the remote to that folder:\nripa@arch:[~]$ rclone mount gdrive-ripa: ~/Google-Drive/ Keep that terminal window open—rclone mount runs in the foreground. Peek inside ~/Google-Drive/ and you should see the same contents as your actual Drive. If everything looks good, congrats, the mount works.\nTo unmount, just close the terminal or hit Ctrl+C in the window that’s running rclone mount.\nWant it in the background? Add \u0026amp; to the command:\nripa@arch:[~]$ rclone mount gdrive-ripa: ~/Google-Drive/ \u0026amp; That’s it—now your Google Drive behaves like any other folder on your system.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:55799/en/posts/integrating-google-drive-on-linux-with-rclone/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet’s get straight to it.
